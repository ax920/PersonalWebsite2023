	'For the first one, I implemented and tested the release of a feature that reduces the amount of polling that a particular service makes; thousands of API requests were made as often as every minute, and many were unnecessary. In order to measure the success of this task, I built a dashboard to monitor the success of my work. It turns out that by decreasing the volume of API requests, I was able to decrease monthly costs by 10% for this service.';

	"For the second milestone, I carried out the end to end design for a feature that the forecasting team had been requesting for a while. This feature allows for math operations on time-series data (AWS CloudWatch offers this but my team's service didn't offer it). This is useful because it reduces the amount of manual work the forecasting team has to do, allowing them to instead focus their time on more meaningful tasks. While I didn't have enough time to finish the implementation, this feature eventually did make its way to production.";

This project has been really rewarding because I essentially had the opportunity to build it from the ground up; I've had a lot of freedom with the design, vision, and architecture. It's currently hosted on AWS using Amplify and EC2.";
